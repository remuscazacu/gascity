// OrderSuppressedPayload is the typed payload for order.suppressed events. It
// carries everything needed to name a stalled order without a second query:
// which scoped order is being held back, how many consecutive dispatch checks
// its open-work gate has refused, and how long that has been going on.
//
// FirstSuppressed is the streak anchor (RFC3339) — the tick that opened the
// current run of refusals, not the emission time, which is already the
// envelope's Ts. SuppressedForMS is the gap between them, carried explicitly so
// a reader does not have to do date arithmetic to answer "how long".
//
// The Blocker fields name WHAT to act on. The streak fields answer "how long has
// this order been held back"; they cannot answer "held back by what", and that
// is the question an operator has to answer before anything changes — the gate
// reopens when the blocking bead closes, so its id is the whole remedy. They are
// resolved by a separate best-effort read at emission time (never per tick), so
// they are omitempty: a lookup that fails or races the blocker closing must
// leave the event exactly as informative as it was before these existed, never
// suppress it.
//
// BlockerAgeMS is the blocker's own age at emission, which is NOT SuppressedForMS:
// the streak starts at the first tick on which the order was DUE and refused,
// while the blocker has usually been open since the previous run poured it. For
// a 4h cron whose wisp was never worked, the blocker is ~4h older than the
// streak. Both are carried because the gap between them is itself diagnostic.
